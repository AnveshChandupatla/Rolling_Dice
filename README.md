# Rolling_Dice
A dice is a small throwable object with multiple resting positions, used for generating random
number. This makes dice suitable as gambling devices for games like craps, or for use in
non-gambling tabletop games. A traditional die is an often rounded cube, with each of its six
faces showing a different number. The design as a whole is aimed at the die providing a
randomly determined integer from one to six, each of those values being equally likely. A
variety of similar devices are also described as dice; such specialized dice may have
polyhedral or irregular shapes and may have faces marked with symbols instead of numbers.
They may be used to produce results other than one through six. Loaded and crooked dice
are designed to favor some results over others for purposes of cheating or amusement

In this project, 
A dice has 6 sides and each side represented by a unique number from 1 to 6. 
It can be rolled in four ways they are Right, Left, Up and Down. 
Initially, the user prompted a dice with a random face values followed by four options to enter one of them. 
If user gives any input from prompted options, the dice should be rolled/changed accordingly the user input. 
And updated values should be printed.
